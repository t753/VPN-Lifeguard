Rename folder "src" to ".src"

You can install the application from the .deb file. That way the application can remember
the applications to monitor each time you start it.

Then you can load the project into Gambas3, make the edits (not necessary in this repository),
and then make an executable (VPNLifeguard.gambas). You can then copy and paste the executable to the desktop,
and just run it.
