This application can be used if you're using OpenVPN and you have a list of vpn connections to choose in your tray.
If you're using an app provided with your VPN Provider then it probably has a kill switch, which will disconnect your
internet connection completely if you lose your VPN connection. That might not be desirable when you intermittenly or
regularly lose your VPN connection.

This application is an alternative that, if you lose your VPN connection, it tries to re-eastablish it, and also restarts
any applications that were monitored by it (the application kills those applications when the VPN connection is initially lost).

If you want o use this fork of the app then it lists all of your VPN possible connections on the main window, which you can
select one and connect to it. Check to see if your VPN provider has an OpenVPN setup as an alternative to using their app.

You can load the project into Gambas3, make the edits (not necessary in this repository),
and then make an executable (VPNLifeguard.gambas). You can then copy and paste the executable to the desktop,
and just run it.

Or you can just copy VPNLifeguard2.gambas to where you want and just run it. The gambas dependecy must be installed to run it:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gambas-team/gambas3  
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gambas3
